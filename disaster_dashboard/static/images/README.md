# Logo Directory

Please add the `vihangam_logo.png` file to this directory. 

The logo should be:
- A monochrome white or primary accent color version of the Vihangam logo
- Optimized for use in the navigation bar (approximately 32x32px or similar)
- Without the text "Vihangam" as it's already present in the navbar
- Suitable for dark theme backgrounds

For now, the system will continue using the FontAwesome helicopter icon until the logo is added.
